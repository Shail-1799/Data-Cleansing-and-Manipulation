# Data-Cleansing-and-Manipulation

 
Data Analyst: Case Study 1 
 
Objective - The raw products data for a store, needs to be cleaned according to the input required for a machine learning algorithm. 
 
Input- A csv file which contains the following columns-  
1.	variant_id (Unique ID of the product variant) 
2.	title_long (Description of the product variant) 
3.	product_type (Type of product, e.g.- t-shirt, trousers, saree, etc) 
4.	handle (Description of the product variant) 
5.	color (Product Color) 
6.	store_name (Name of the Store) 
 
Problem to be solved- 
The product_type is an important feature for analysis, and prediction. However, the data we receive has a lot of missing/ redundant/ false information, which needs to be rectified. 
 
Develop a functionality to clean the product_type column of the data, to treat the following pain areas- 
1.	Missing values 
2.	Spelling Mistakes (necklace/ nklce, sari/ saree, pearl/ parl, maang tika/ maang tikka) 
3.	Generic product types (like Jewellery for all the products of a jewellery store, Saris & Lehengas) 
4.	Similar Products with different names (t-shirt/ tshirt, tank tops/womenâ€™s tank tops)
